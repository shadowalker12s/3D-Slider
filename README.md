# 3D-Slider
 3D Rotating Slider with CSS and HTML is a visually appealing web project that showcases a dynamic 3D rotating image slider. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, this project demonstrates the power of CSS animations and transforms to create a modern, interactive experience without the need for JavaScript.  The design features a sleek 3D carousel of images, smoothly rotating in space, accompanied by layered text and a model background image. The text remains prominent in the foreground, creating a multi-dimensional effect. This project is perfect for web designers looking to experiment with CSS-only animations and effects, as well as those aiming to build unique UI/UX components.
